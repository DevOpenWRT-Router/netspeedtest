## Write in front: [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Write in front-F5F5F5.svg)](#Write in front-)

 I have been looking for a plug-in to test the speed on OPENWRT, but I couldn't find it, so I have it!
This plug-in can carry out internal, external and external network speed tests.

1. The internal network speed test is based on the iperf3 plug-in. If the server router is not installed, please install this ipk plug-in first.

2. The terminal using the speed measurement machine must be in the same local area network as the speed measurement server!

3. Client use steps:
  Start the speed test server -> download the test client -> run the speed test client -> enter the server IP address -> view the results.

5. The client is running. There is "iperf3 speed test client" in the domestic download. Just run it and enter the server IP.
  For the original foreign version, you need to manually enter the CMD command mode, and then enter the command: iperf3.exe -c server IP

6. Network speed test iperf3 client download address: https://sipdboy.lanzoui.com/b01c3esih Password: cpd6

8. Use speedtest.net speed test kernel for external network speed measurement, and need to rely on speedtest. In addition, thanks to superspeed and user1121114685 for borrowing your inspiration!

9. The final test stage of the external network speed test thanks to Zuo Dai: Sasuo Test and check the problem!

10. New plugins will inevitably have bugs, please don't make a fuss. Welcome to submit bugs.
